### Ljubomir Stevancevic - Junior PHP Developer

üëã Hi, I'm Ljubomir, a Junior PHP Developer with a passion for programming and a background in economics. I've spent seven years in the banking industry and three years working for a remote email company. My love for coding led me to make a career switch. I'm always learning and striving to improve my code, so I welcome any feedback or contributions you might have.

üíª On my GitHub profile, you can find a selection of projects that I've worked on covering different topics that I'm studying:
* [Jobify-API](https://github.com/LjubomirS/Jobify-API) - REST API for a job board built with Symfony 
* [BlogAPI](https://github.com/LjubomirS/BlogAPI) - REST API to handle requests for a blog post built with Slim, Swagger/OpenAPI, PHPStan, and CodeSniffer
* [Carty-Craft](https://github.com/LjubomirS/Carty-Craft) - web app that utilizes OOP, MySQL, PDO, and Composer to build shopping platform with CRUD functionality

üéì I hold a degree in Web Design from IT Academy, and I studied at Jagaad Academy, where I honed my skills in Backend development with PHP, Symfony, MySQL, and Object-Oriented Programming. 

üîç I'm currently looking for opportunities to work as a junior developer, and I'm excited about the prospect of contributing to great solutions and continuing to develop my skills. If you'd like to get in touch, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ljubomir-stevancevic/). Alternatively, feel free to [drop me an email](mailto:ljubomir.stevancevic@gmail.com) - I'd love to hear from you!
