### Ljubomir Stevancevic - Junior PHP Developer

👋 Hi, I'm Ljubomir, a Junior PHP Developer with a passion for programming and a background in economics. I've spent seven years in the banking industry and three years working for a remote email company. My love for coding led me to make a career switch.

🎓 I hold a degree in Web Design from IT Academy, and I studied at Jagaad Academy, where I honed my skills in Backend development with PHP, Symfony, MySQL, and Object-Oriented Programming.

👨‍💻 On my GitHub profile, you can find a selection of projects that I've worked on covering different topics that I'm studying. I'm always learning and striving to improve my code, so I welcome any feedback or contributions you might have.

🔍 I'm currently looking for opportunities to work as a junior developer, and I'm excited about the prospect of contributing to great solutions and continuing to develop my skills. If you'd like to get in touch, you can find me on LinkedIn. Alternatively, feel free to drop me an email - I'd love to hear from you!
